## Check

Prepare your environment exactly like you will do for the experiment.

Execute the following steps on the laptop you will use during the experiment:

1. switch your brain mode to on;
2. navigate to this URL: https://url-obfuscated
3. download the archive and extract it (e.g. using 7-zip, password: `password-obfuscated`); 
4. import `check.c` in your IDE (if you use one); 
5. DO NOT MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE IN ANY WAY (not even the file name); 
6. build the program; 
7. follow the instructions the program will give you; 
8. debug the built application; 
9. retrieve the value of the `spyme` variable immediately before the end of main function; 
10. use the value you get in the previous step to fill the following form field (a decimal value, not hexadecimal, e.g. `123456`).

Answer the questions referring to the experience you have right now (don't
cheat, please).

### This is the field to fill
